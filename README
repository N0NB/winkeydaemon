winkeydaemon - Morse daemon for the winkey hardware keyer module

winkeydaemon is a driver for the winkey2 keyer. It provides an interface
which is compatible to the cwdaemon, which means it can be used instead of
the cwdaemon.

The winkeydaemon listens to a udp socket and outputs commands to the k1el
keyer on a serial port.

This archive is an effort by Nate Bargmann to colate the changes made by
Rein, Joop, and Wilbert over the years and make them public.  Fixes and
updates will be welcome.
