Installation is rather simple, copy the winkeydaemon script to a convenient
directory.  If the directory is in your path, then it can be run as
'winkeydaemon [options]', otherwise the full path must be provided.

Operation from a normal user account is possible so long as the account is a
member of the group of the serial device.  Often this is the 'dialout' group
but may vary among distributions.

An init script is provided for those wishing to start winkeydaemon as a system
service.

The Perl module Device::SerialPort is required.  For Debian and derivatives
this can be found as the libdevice-serialport-perl package.  For Slackware and
derivatives this can be found on Slackbuilds dot org ⟨http://slackbuilds.org⟩
as the perl-Device-SerialPort build script.  Other distributions will vary.
It is always available from meta::cpan
⟨https://metacpan.org/release/Device-SerialPort⟩.
